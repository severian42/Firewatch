# Firewatch App Guide

Welcome to Firewatch! This guide explains all the features available to help you stay informed, document encounters, and protect your rights.

## The Dashboard (Home Screen)

Your central hub for quick actions and status updates.

*   **Panic Button:** The large red button at the top. Pressing it opens the Emergency Modal, giving you two critical options.
*   **Emergency Broadcast & Record:** Press and hold this button to simultaneously send a pre-written SMS alert with your location to your designated Emergency Contacts and start a covert audio recording.
*   **Covert Record:** Press and hold this to start a discreet audio recording without sending an alert.
*   **Quick Action Buttons:**
    *   **Quick Record:** Jumps you to the Document screen to start recording.
    *   **Legal Hotline:** Dials the ACLU's general number. You must confirm before the call is placed.
    *   **Share Location:** Uses your device's native share feature to send a Google Maps link of your current location.
*   **Area Status:** Shows a color-coded threat level (Red, Yellow, Green) based on the latest verified community alerts. This gives you an at-a-glance sense of local activity.
*   **Dashboard Toolkit:** A set of four powerful mini-apps for on-the-spot information.

## Dashboard Toolkit Explained

*   **Know Your Script:** Cycles through key legal phrases (e.g., "I do not consent to a search."). Use the "Copy" button to put the phrase on your clipboard.
*   **State Recording Law:** Enter any U.S. state to see if it's a "One-Party" or "Two-Party" consent state for recording audio. This is crucial for understanding your rights when filming.
*   **Incident Checklist:** An interactive checklist of important steps to take during or after an incident (e.g., getting badge numbers). Your progress is saved as you check items off.
*   **Legal Jargon Buster:** Enter a complex legal term (like "probable cause" or "exculpatory evidence") and get a simple, plain-language definition.

## Alerts Screen

This screen provides real-time intelligence.

*   **Live Area Scan:** This is the primary feature.
    *   **Scan My Area:** Uses your device's GPS to perform an AI-powered search of recent news and social media for civil rights-related events in your immediate vicinity.
    *   **Manual Scan:** You can also type in any city, state, or zip code to scan a different location. This is useful for checking on family or planning travel.
    *   The scan provides a summary and a list of source links.
*   **Community Verified Alerts:** A feed of curated, high-priority alerts that have been vetted by the community.

## Know Your Rights Screen

An educational resource to prepare you for potential encounters.

*   **Topics:** Select a scenario (like "Traffic Stop" or "Home Visit") to read a detailed guide on your rights and recommended actions in that situation.
*   **Scenario Simulator:** (Coming Soon!) Interactive modules that let you practice responding to various situations.

## Document Screen

Your secure evidence locker.

*   **Recording:** Use the buttons to launch the recorder for video, audio, or photos. The recorder is a placeholder and simulates the recording process.
*   **Evidence List:** All your saved recordings appear here. Tap any item to view its details.
*   **Evidence Details:** In the detail view, you can:
    *   **Edit:** Change the title and add detailed notes to your evidence.
    *   **Delete:** Permanently and securely delete evidence after a confirmation. All data is stored locally on your device for privacy.

## Guide Screen

This screen contains this App Guide and other essential resources.

*   **App Documentation:** The guide you are reading right now.
*   **Resource Categories:** Find lists of external organizations that can help, such as:
    *   National Legal Organizations
    *   Immigration Resources
    *   Bail & Community Funds

## Settings Screen

Customize the app to your needs.

*   **Fallback Location:** Set a default city/state/zip. The Live Area Scan will use this location if you deny GPS permissions or if it can't get a location lock.
*   **Emergency Contacts:** Add, edit, or remove the phone numbers of people you want to alert when you use the Emergency Broadcast feature. This is the most important setting to configure!

Remember: This app is a tool to empower you with information. It is not a substitute for legal advice. Always try to consult with a qualified attorney for legal matters.
