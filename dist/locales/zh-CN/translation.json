    "content": "# Firewatch App Guide\n\nWelcome to Firewatch! This guide explains all the features available to help you stay informed, document encounters, and protect your rights.\n\n## The Dashboard (Home Screen)\n\nYour central hub for quick actions and status updates.\n\n* **Panic Button:** The large red button at the top. Pressing it opens the Emergency Modal, giving you two critical options.\n* **Emergency Broadcast & Record:** Press and hold this button to simultaneously send a pre-written SMS alert with your location to your designated Emergency Contacts and start a covert audio recording.\n* **Covert Record:** Press and hold this to start a discreet audio recording without sending an alert.\n* **Quick Action Buttons:**\n  * **Quick Record:** Jumps you to the Document screen to start recording.\n  * **Legal Hotline:** Dials the ACLU's general number. You must confirm before the call is placed.\n  * **Share Location:** Uses your device's native share feature to send a Google Maps link of your current location.\n* **Area Status:** Shows a color-coded threat level (Red, Yellow, Green) based on the latest verified community alerts. This gives you an at-a-glance sense of local activity.\n* **Dashboard Toolkit:** A set of four powerful mini-apps for on-the-spot information.\n\n## Dashboard Toolkit Explained\n\n* **Know Your Script:** Cycles through key legal phrases (e.g., \"I do not consent to a search.\"). Use the \"Copy\" button to put the phrase on your clipboard.\n* **State Recording Law:** Enter any U.S. state to see if it's a \"One-Party\" or \"Two-Party\" consent state for recording audio. This is crucial for understanding your rights when filming.\n* **Incident Checklist:** An interactive checklist of important steps to take during or after an incident (e.g., getting badge numbers). Your progress is saved as you check items off.\n* **Legal Jargon Buster:** Enter a complex legal term (like \"probable cause\" or \"exculpatory evidence\") and get a simple, plain-language definition.\n\n## Alerts Screen\n\nThis screen provides real-time intelligence.\n\n* **Live Area Scan:** This is the primary feature.\n  * **Scan My Area:** Uses your device's GPS to perform an AI-powered search of recent news and social media for civil rights-related events in your immediate vicinity.\n  * **Manual Scan:** You can also type in any city, state, or zip code to scan a different location. This is useful for checking on family or planning travel.\n  * The scan provides a summary and a list of source links.\n* **Community Verified Alerts:** A feed of curated, high-priority alerts that have been vetted by the community.\n\n## Know Your Rights Screen\n\nAn educational resource to prepare you for potential encounters.\n\n* **Topics:** Select a scenario (like \"Traffic Stop\" or \"Home Visit\") to read a detailed guide on your rights and recommended actions in that situation.\n* **Scenario Simulator:** (Coming Soon!) Interactive modules that let you practice responding to various situations.\n\n## Document Screen\n\nYour secure evidence locker.\n\n* **Recording:** Use the buttons to launch the recorder for video, audio, or photos. The recorder is a placeholder and simulates the recording process.\n* **Evidence List:** All your saved recordings appear here. Tap any item to view its details.\n* **Evidence Details:** In the detail view, you can:\n  * **Edit:** Change the title and add detailed notes to your evidence.\n  * **Delete:** Permanently and securely delete evidence after a confirmation. All data is stored locally on your device for privacy.\n\n## Guide Screen\n\nThis screen contains this App Guide and other essential resources.\n\n* **App Documentation:** The guide you are reading right now.\n* **Resource Categories:** Find lists of external organizations that can help, such as:\n  * National Legal Organizations\n  * Immigration Resources\n  * Bail & Community Funds\n\n## Settings Screen\n\nCustomize the app to your needs.\n\n* **Fallback Location:** Set a default city/state/zip. The Live Area Scan will use this location if you deny GPS permissions or if it can't get a location lock.\n* **Emergency Contacts:** Add, edit, or remove the phone numbers of people you want to alert when you use the Emergency Broadcast feature. This is the most important setting to configure!\n\nRemember: This app is a tool to empower you with information. It is not a substitute for legal advice. Always try to consult with a qualified attorney for legal matters."

If the officer asks, you can say \"Officer, I do not consent to searches.\"\n* If the officer has probable cause, they may be able to search your car anyway.\n\n## What to Say\n* Provide your driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance when requested.\n* You are only required to identify yourself. You do not have to answer questions about where you are going or where you are coming from.\n* You can state, \"I am going to remain silent.\"\n* If you wish to end the interaction, you can ask, \"Am I free to go?\"\n\n## Important Rights\n* **The Fourth Amendment** protects you from unreasonable searches and seizures. Generally, police need a warrant to search your property, but there are exceptions for vehicles.\n* **The Fifth Amendment** gives you the right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination.",
    "home_visit": "# Home Visit\n\n## What to Do\n* Do not open your door to law enforcement unless they have a warrant signed by a judge.\n* If they say they have a warrant, ask them to slip it under the door or hold it up to a window so you can read it.\n* A warrant must specify the address to be searched and the people or things to be seized.\n* If they do not have a warrant, you do not have to let them in, and you do not have to answer their questions. You can speak to them through the closed door.\n\n## What to Say\n* \"Officer, do you have a warrant?\"\n* If they don't have a warrant: \"I do not consent to you entering my home.\"\n* \"I am going to remain silent. I want to speak with a lawyer.\"\n* You do not have to answer any questions.\n\n## Important Rights\n* **The Fourth Amendment** provides the strongest protection for your home.

    "public_protest": "# Public Protest\n\n## What to Do\n* You can generally protest in public spaces like streets, sidewalks, and parks.\n* You may need a permit for larger protests, marches, or if you are using sound amplification. Check local regulations.\n* Police can order you to disperse if the protest becomes violent or is blocking access to public or private property.

You do not need to answer other questions.\n* Repeat these phrases as necessary. Answering one question can sometimes be interpreted as waiving your right to remain silent for further questions.\n\n## Important Rights\n* **The Fifth Amendment** gives you the right to remain silent and not incriminate yourself.\n* **The Sixth Amendment** gives you the right to an attorney. You should invoke this right immediately upon being arrested.",
