## üîß **API Configuration**

### Why an API Key?
AI features (area scanning, legal jargon explanations) require a free Gemini API key. **This is completely optional** - all core, non-AI features work without it.

### Getting Your Free API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Create new API key
4. Copy key to Firewatch Settings
5. Click "Save Settings"

### What the API Does
- **Local area threat scanning**: Searches public information for enforcement activity
- **Legal jargon explanations**: Clarifies complex legal terms
- **State law lookups**: Checks recording consent laws by state

**Important**: The API never receives your location, personal data, or app usage patterns. It only gets the specific queries you choose to make.
